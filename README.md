## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have Node 12.0.0 or up. We recommend upgrading to the LTS version of NodeJS available at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). You can also use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

## Installation

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# development (docker mode using docker compose)
$ npm run start:docker

# development (watch mode)
$ npm run watch

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# e2e and unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# unit tests
$ npm run test:unit

# e2e tests (watch mode)
$ npm run test:watch:e2e

# unit tests (watch mode)
$ npm run test:watch:unit
```

## Run dynamodb-admin viewer

1. Run `npm install -g dynamodb-admin`
2. Run localstack with dynamodb service
3. set env `$env:DYNAMO_ENDPOINT = "http://localhost:4566"` (for windows)
4. Check env if set `Get-ChildItem Env:DYNAMO_ENDPOINT`
5. If all good then Run `dynamodb-admin`

### Examples on using query builder, pagination and sorting

Import the postman collection (`nestjs-template.postman_collection.json`) from `docs/postman` folder to [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app for more detailed example requests and responses.

```javascript
{
    "listTasksFilterInput": {
        "filter": [
            {
                "id": [1]
            }
        ],
        "operators": [
            {
                "id": "In"
            }
        ],
        "sorting": {
            "sortBy": ["id"],
            "sortDir": ["DESC"]
        },
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "pageSize": 20
        }
    }
}
```

- **filter** - an array of objects based on the `key` as the property of entity and `value` as the data to be queried / filtered
- **operators** - an array of objects based on the `key` as the property of entity and `value` as the [find operators](https://github.com/lambdas-crew/nestjs-template-project/blob/master/src/graphql/common/enums/options-operator.enum.ts)
- **sorting**
  - `sortBy` - based on the property of the entity to be sorted
  - `sortDir` - based on the sort direction (`ASC`, `DESC`)
- **pagination**
  - `page` - offset (paginated) from where entities should be taken
  - `pageSize` - limit (paginated) number of entities should be taken

## CRUD Generator

Generate module, resolver, service, entity and DTO objects based on the model / table in the following steps.

### 1) Generating new resource

<pre>
$ npm run generate:resource graphql/<b>entities</b>
</pre>

- **entities** - replace with the entity on plural form like (`products`, `users`) you want to generate

### 2) Transport layer - GraphQL (code first)

<pre>
? What transport layer do you use? 
  REST API 
‚ùØ <b>GraphQL (code first)</b>
  GraphQL (schema first) 
  Microservice (non-HTTP) 
  WebSockets
</pre>

### 3) Generate CRUD entry

<pre>
? Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? (Y/n) <b>Y</b>
</pre>

### 4) Generated resource entity files

```bash
CREATE src/graphql/products/products.module.ts
CREATE src/graphql/products/products.resolver.ts
CREATE src/graphql/products/products.service.ts
CREATE src/graphql/products/dto/create-product.input.ts
CREATE src/graphql/products/dto/update-product.input.ts
CREATE src/graphql/products/entities/product.entity.ts
UPDATE src/graphql/app.module.ts
```

### 5) Modify CRUD resolver names and Update repository logics

- Rename the generated CRUD resolver method names according to `task.resolver` CRUD logics
- Update generated service according to `task.service` CRUD logics
- Add repository entity according to `task.repository` CRUD logics

## Configuration

Configs such as (`DB credentials`, `server config`, `authentication config`) are located on `config` folder on which the place to update / store configuration variables that are based on different environments.

## Commit Standards

### Commit Convention

<pre>
$ git commit -m "<b>type</b>(<b>ticket-number</b>): <b>description</b>"
</pre>

- **type** - types like (`feat`, `fix`) related on the ticket
- **ticket-number** - identity number related on the ticket
- **description** - message body related on the ticket

### Linting and Consistent Style

```bash
# automatically find and fix lint errors
$ npm run lint:fix

# automatically rewrites unformatted files
$ npm run prettier:fix
```
